## Important:  
Remember that you can get update notifications for my custom commands if you join my [discord server](/https://discord.gg/GRns3f) and __follow__ my announcement channel or give yourself the role that pings you for any updates  
  
If you visited this repo without knowing about [my website](https://www.thehdcraftergaming.tk/yagpdb) and my [discord server](/https://discord.gg/GRns3f) it would be nice if you could check it out. *There you can also find more stuff and code that is not shown here on github ;)*  
Thank you :)

## Licence:  
You do not have to include [the full licence](https://github.com/TheHDCrafter/yagpdb-cc/blob/master/LICENSE) in the code because it is too long. Thats why i made this small text that HAS TO STAY in the code if it is added there. 
If that licence can not be found in some code on this repository, you will not need to add it and can do whatever you want with the code.  

This is the small licence text that is added into most of the code:
```
Copyright: 2020 TheHDCrafter
License: MIT
Repository: https://github.com/TheHDCrafter/yagpdb-cc/
```
